# Personal system preferences

This is just a few of my personal system preferences, updated over time, for when I change machines. Nothing is commented and you'd likely be better off using another guide instead of trying to decipher what I have here.

# File locations

```
~/.vimrc
~/.tmux.conf
~/.config/i3/config
```

For i3 you'll have to install feh (sudo pacman -S feh) and you may have to move the config out of etc
